# Correlation Between Breastfeeding and Gluten Sensitivity

This project analyzes the relationship between breastfeeding practices in infancy and the risk of developing gluten sensitivity (celiac disease). The goal is to identify possible correlations using data from multiple sources and API integrations.

# Data sources
Data for this project comes from:
- Breastfeeding data from [HealthData.gov](https://healthdata.gov/api/views/x7kq-cyv4/rows.csv) 
- Celiac disease data from Kaggle dataset "Celiac Disease - Coeliac Disease" by Jackwin07
- Infant feeding patterns and growth dataset from Kaggle by Chidirolex

| Dataset                  | Source                              | Size          |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------|
| Breastfeeding data       | HealthData.gov CSV API             | ~1,000 rows   |
| Celiac disease records   | Kaggle dataset                     | 2,206 rows    |
| Infant feeding patterns  | Kaggle dataset                     | ~1,000 rows   |

# Results
Initial analysis suggests potential patterns between breastfeeding duration/type and later gluten sensitivity rates. Further analysis is ongoing to confirm statistical significance.
